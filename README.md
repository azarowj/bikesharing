## Overview
This analysis came about from someone wanting to start a bikeshare business in Des Moines, Iowa similar to that of CitiBike in New York City. In order to determine how this might work in Des Moines, we first need to figure out how it works currently in NYC. The basis of this analysis, is to figure out the basics of how CitiBike works in NYC and then extrapolate that data to determine how it might work in Des Moines.

## Results

The data visualizations made in Tableau can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jennifer.azarow#!/vizhome/BikesharingChallenge_16217151773720/CitiBikes?publish=yes).

- The first page of the story shows two graphs. The first graph shows the amount of time the bikes were checked out in general. The second graph shows the amount of time bikes were checked out by gender. The comparison of the graphs shows that men and women follow the same pattern of trip duration. The vast majority of trips last approximately 5 minutes. 
- The second story point shows two charts. The first chart shows the trips by weekday per hour. The second chart breaks this down further by gender. This comparison confirms that men and women follow a similar pattern. On Monday through Friday, the majority of bike trips occur during commuting hours, before and after work. On Saturday and Sunday, the majority of bike trips happen throughtout the day, approximately 10AM to 7PM. Wednesday after work has less bike trips than the other weekdays.
- The third story point shows a graph comparing the usertype and the gender. There are similar numbers of male and female short-term users. However, there are significantly more male subscribers than female subscribers
- The fourth story point shows two maps. The first map shows the top starting locations. The second map shows the top ending locations. The two maps are nearly identical. This shows that popular starting locations are also popular ending locations.


## Summary

- One of the key takeaways is that bikes are extremely popular during commuting hours and throughout the day on weekends. Another important takeaway is that men subscribe to the service at a much higher rate than women. Popular starting locations are also popular ending locations. Those familiar with NYC will note that the most popular locations are high density commerical areas.
- I would also want to add visualizations for the starting and ending locations by gender. I would also add visualizations for the starting and ending locations by birth year.
